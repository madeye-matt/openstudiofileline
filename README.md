# openstudiofileline
A simple C# program to open a file at a specified line in Visual Studio 15 (so that I can keep my code bookmarks in Emacs org-mode and open them in Visual Studio with a single click)

This code was ripped entirely from [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/350323/open-a-file-in-visual-studio-at-a-specific-line-number).  Many thanks to those contributors
